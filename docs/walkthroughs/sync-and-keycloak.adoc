Data Sync and Keycloak in the MCP
---------------------------------

[[prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* An OpenShift Cluster with:
** the MCP UI extension enabled
** Mobile Services available in the Service Catalog
** a Project containing the MCP Server

See link:../../README.adoc#walkthroughs[MCP walkthroughs] for
install/setup & other walkthroughs.

[[provision-data-sync]]
Provision Data Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Sync can be provisioned from the Service Catalog. It creates a
Deployment for MongoDB, Redis and the Node.js sync server. A route is
exposed for the Node.js sync server. This is what the Mobile App will
talk to. The MCP UI can be accessed from the `Mobile' item in the
Project left navigation. When provisioned, the Data Sync service appears
on the Mobile Overview screen as a Mobile Enabled Service.

[[integrate-data-sync-with-a-mobile-app]]
Integrate Data Sync with a Mobile App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate Data Sync with a Mobile App, the
https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync-js[fh-sync-js] client will be used.
The Mobile App will be a Cordova App. Back in the Service Catalog,
choose a Cordova App from the `Mobile > Apps' sub-category. This will
create a representation of an App in the MCP UI.

The MCP UI helps by providing sample code for the Cordova client. The
goal is to configure the Mobile App where the Data Sync service is. This
is split into 2 parts. 1, get the config. And 2, set the config.

The first part can be done by using the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@akeating-redhat/fh-mobile-core[Mobile
Core] library. The Mobile Core library allows retrieval of configuration
for all Mobile Enabled services the MCP knows about. The MCP UI provides
an example Mobile Core config to drop into the Mobile App. This config
is the location of the MCP server, our App ID and an API Key. e.g.

[source,json]
----
{
  "host":"https://127.0.0.1:3001",
  "appID":"myapp-1508169992",
  "apiKey":"3ac24f15-022b-4be1-b5a4-03eafe9349f3"
}
----

The Mobile Core library can be initialised using this config:

[source,js]
----
const mobileCore = require('fh-mobile-core');
const mcpConfig = require('../mcpConfig.json');

mobileCore.configure(mcpConfig).then((config) => {
  // Initialise the rest of your app.
});
----

When the Mobile Core library gets initialized with this config, it makes
a call to the MCP server. The server responds with the Data Sync
configuration. This configuration can be passed into the Sync client to
initialize it.

[source,js]
----
mobileCore.configure(mcpConfig).then((config) => {
  const syncConfig = config.getConfigFor('fh-sync-server');
  sync.init({
    cloudUrl: syncConfig.uri,
    storage_strategy: 'dom'
  });
  sync.manage('myDataset', null, {}, {}, () => {
    // Initialise the rest of your app.
  });
});
----

Now we can use the Sync client API throughout our Mobile App to create,
read, update and delete data, knowing that the data will be synchronized
to the server. A bonus feature of the MCP UI for integrated services is
Stats. For the Data Sync service, various Sync related stats are
available from the Data Sync Dashboard in the MCP UI.

[[adding-authentication-and-authorization-to-the-mobile-app]]
Adding Authentication and Authorization to the Mobile App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can build on the Data Sync integration to provide authentication (via
http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak]) in our Mobile App. We can also use
the token that Keycloak gives to authenticated users for authorization.
First, the Keycloak service in the Service Catalog should be
provisioned. This will create the Keycloak Deployment, Service and
Route. It will also creates a Realm and Client in Keycloak.

We can use this Realm & Client for the Data Sync Integration. However,
we will need to enabled the `Implicit Flow' for the Client in the
Keycloak UI (one time only). The MCP UI will show possible integrations
between Mobile Enabled Services. In the Data Sync service `Integrations'
tab, there is an option to enable the Keycloak integration. Enable this
so the MCP Server will include Keycloak client details in the config
that gets sent to the Mobile App. A secret will also get mounted into
the Data Sync pod with details of the Keycloak realm and client.

The MCP UI gives an example of configuring the
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-js-bower[keycloak-js adapter] in
our Cordova app.

[source,js]
----
const keycloakAuth = new Keycloak(keycloakConfig);

keycloakAuth.init({ onLoad: 'login-required', flow: 'implicit' }).success(() => {
  // initialise rest of app
}).error((err) => {
  // init failed
});
----

This will pop up a login page as soon as the App starts

Back in OpenShift, the Data Sync service looks for the mounted Keycloak
Secret, and changes its behaviour if found. It will check for an
authorization header in each Data Sync request from the Mobile App. It
then calls to Keycloak (using the credentials from the Secret) to check
if the user has access (read/write) to the data. To read data, a user
should have the `sync_read' Realm Role. To write data, the user should
have the `sync_write' Realm Role. Users and Roles can be managed as
needed directly through the Keycloak UI.

You can get the Route for the Keycloak UI from the Keycloak Service
Dashboard in the MCP UI, or by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
oc get route keycloak
----

In the Mobile App, the keycloak-js adapter takes care of popping up a
login screen. To ensure the token is sent with every request to the Data
Sync service, the Sync handler should be overwritten to add the extra
Authorization header:

[source,js]
----
const syncCloudUrl = syncConfig.uri + '/sync/';
const syncCloudHandler = buildSyncCloudHandler(syncCloudUrl, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + keycloakAuth.token
  }
});
Sync.setCloudHandler(syncCloudHandler);
----

To improve user feedback in the App, we can check the Userâ€™s roles ahead
of time. For example, if the User only has the `sync_read' Role, the UI
should *not* show the Create/Update options for data. This will avoid
unnecessary calls to the Data Sync service when we know they are going
to fail.

[source,js]
----
function canWrite() {
  if (keycloakAuth.hasRealmRole('sync_write')) {
    return true
  }
  return false;
}
----
