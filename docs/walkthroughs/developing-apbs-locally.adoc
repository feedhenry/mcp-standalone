Developing APBs Locally
-----------------------

Create a cluster pointing at your own docker organisation, this will
also copy all the existing APBs in feedhenry to the dockerhub_org:

....
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "dockerhub_username=<dockerusername>" -e "dockerhub_password=<dockerpassword>" -e "dockerhub_org=<USE_THIS_VALUE>" -e "apb_sync=true" --ask-become-pass
....

If the APB you wish to develop already exists in the feedhenry
organisation, then syncing that APB can be skipped by adding:

....
-e "skip_apb=<apb-name>"
....

Make your changes locally, and change the image name in the `apb.yml`
file to match your organisation name. Then run:

....
make DOCKERORG=<your-org-name> DOCKERHOST=<docker-host-defaults-to-docker.io>
....

As the `apb.yml` has been updated, you will need to do a push, run:

....
apb push --broker=<asb-broker-route>
....

The APB is now in the catalog and ready to be tested.
