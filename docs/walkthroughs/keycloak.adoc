Keycloak in the MCP
-------------------

This guide will walk you through provisioning the Keycloak service from the
OpenShift service catalog and using it with an app using the Mobile Control
Panel (MCP).

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* An OpenShift Cluster with:
** the MCP UI extension enabled
** Mobile Services available in the Service Catalog
** a Project containing the MCP Server

See link:../../README.adoc#walkthroughs[MCP walkthroughs] for
install/setup & other walkthroughs.

Provision Keycloak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keycloak can be provisioned from the OpenShift service catalog.

Navigate to the Service Catalog -> Mobile -> Services -> Keycloak.

Create the Keycloak service.

A number of tasks will be performed while provisioning:

* Create a Keycloak instance
* Create a realm in Keycloak with the same name as the OpenShift project
* Create two clients in the realm, one for a client and one for a server

Configuring Keycloak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once keycloak has successfully provisioned it can be configured by going to the
Keycloak route. `oc get route keycloak -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"`.

The Keycloak that is provisioned is a normal Keycloak instance, meaning it can
be configured in the same way as any other.

When other services integrate with Keycloak they will use the realm named after
the OpenShift project and the two clients that are created within it. When
trying to add new users, roles or authentication flows to, for example a
FeedHenry Sync integration, that realm should be modified.

Integrate Keycloak with a Mobile Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a number of services can be integrated with Keycloak e.g. FeedHenry Sync.
The Keycloak integration will not be visible for other services.

To integrate Keycloak with the FeedHenry Sync Server navigate to the MCP and
then to the Mobile Enabled Service that will be integrated with Keycloak.
In the Service Integrations tab click Create Integration for Keycloak.

Creating an integration will mount the secret named after a service, in this
case `keycloak`, into the Mobile Enabled Service. The contents of the secret
will then be available in the file system of the service container.
The files that are created will be in the `/etc/secrets/{service-name}`
directory of the service container. For example, when integration Keycloak into
the FeedHenry Sync service, a `/etc/secrets/keycloak` directory will be created
in the sync service container.

Services will detect that new integrations have been made. When, for example,
the FeedHenry Sync service integrates with Keycloak it will restart and detect
that keycloak has been integrated by looking for whether the mounted files
exist. If they do then the service will protect itself using Keycloak.

Integrate Keycloak with a Mobile App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the Keycloak service is successfully provisioned it will be available to
mobile apps using the
link:https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-mobile-core-js[Mobile Core Library].
This library can be used to obtain configuration for all the services available
to an app.

The keycloak configuration can be retrieved in an app using the `getConfigFor`
function. The configuration from this call can be used to initialise the
JavaScript keycloak adapter

[source,js]
----
const mobileCore = require('fh-mobile-core');
const mcpConfig = require('../mcpConfig.json');

mobileCore.configure(mcpConfig).then((config) => {
  const keycloakConfig = config.getConfigFor('keycloak');
  const keycloakAuth = new Keycloak(keycloakConfig);
  keycloakAuth.init({ onLoad: 'login-required', flow: 'implicit' }).success(() => {
    // Initialise the rest of the app
  });
});
