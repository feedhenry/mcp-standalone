The Mobile Control Panel is PoC for a `per namespace' service that helps
developers discover, create and integrate Mobile Apps and Services on
OpenShift.

* Mobile SDKs are developed and maintained in their respective repos
* The Backend is a Golang server in this repo
* The Frontend is a set of AngularJS services, controllers, views etc…
in this repo that extend the OpenShift Web Console UI (via extensions)
* Services are developeed and maintained in their respective repos. They
leverage the Service Catalog and various brokers to help provision them

The MCP brings all of these componments together to create a unified
Mobile developer experience on top of OpenShift.

[[communication]]
Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daily communication happens on #feedhenry on
https://webchat.freenode.net/[freenode IRC]. The
http://feedhenry-dev.2363497.n4.nabble.com/[feedhenry-dev@redhat.com
mailing list] is also used for team-wide & community comms. Issues are
tracked in both
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=4143&view=planning.nodetail[Jira]
and Github Issues. Where issues are duplicates, they should be linked so
that only 1 source of info exists (automation would be nice here).
Typically the core Red Hat team will create and work from Jira Issues.

Installing from a development release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Effectively all you need to do is add the dockerhub_tag to your install command. An example is show below. Note it is important that the image version exists in dockerhub.

....
make clean
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "dockerhub_username=$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" -e "dockerhub_tag=${TAG}" -e "dockerhub_password=$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD" -e "dockerhub_org=$DOCKERHUB_APBS_ORG" -e "skip_apb=keycloak-apb" --ask-become-pass
....
